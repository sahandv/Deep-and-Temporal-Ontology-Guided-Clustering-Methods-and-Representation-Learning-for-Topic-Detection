# Topic Detection and Tracking

This directory includes two main TDT codes. `DEC` directory includes the code for deep embedded clustering, while the `continuous_clustering_ontology_guided_with_keywordembedding_iterative.py` code contains the main class and running subroutines for ontology guided clustering, a.k.a `the `OGC` algorithm.

## OGC

The `continuous_clustering_ontology_guided_with_keywordembedding_iterative.py` contains multiple cells. The intial cell is the main `OGC` algorithm class.

The following cells are the ways we can use `OGC` class. For instance, one of the cells is dedicated to use this class for performing TDT on a Scopus dataset.

The data needed for each type of experiment should be curated with care. The sample data for running these modules/cells/scripts are provided in the `Data` directory, in the root folder.
